What is this purpose of this Git repository

- The git repository acts as my portfolio as a programmer. Using git I can show any potential employers the work that I have done and what I have accomplished

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

- My favorite assignment was a2. a2 was assigned at a time where I could fully devout my attention to it and really learn everything that was going on. Future assignments we're harder because I was consistently having to rush them to manage
to balance all the other work I had.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

- As with many of the Tufts computer science courses I have taken I feel more confident in my ability to teach myself and to adapt to obstacles without the assistance of a third party.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence

- I learned where to even begin when making a web application
- I learned how to come together with a large group of people and stitch together different pieces of code to make a product

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

- I think web security is an incredibly interesting topic to learn about as well as web engineering
