Implementation: Everything is implemented correctly. I could not clone or create a branch. I tried and could not figure it out

I could not get myLat and myLng to stick after being used for my marker so when creating lines I hard coded my coords in so lines all go to my flag marker. Also i realize my code is not very modular and is quite length with functions used to access different parts of the JSON. Would love feedback on how others did it and how to make it more modular.
