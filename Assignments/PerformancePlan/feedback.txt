- Good Lord, is this a presentation?  The font is so small!
- Too many bullet points and words on presentation
- I don't care about non-performance problems
- Optimization and Scaling is all over the place: you talk about databases, networking, caching.  Very unorganized.
+ You got the caching details right
? Why address security challenges here? Is that related to performance? Explain yourselves...
- No details on how your team is going to spend the money
